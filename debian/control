 HTTP::Cookie is a Ruby library to handle HTTP Cookies based on RFC
 6265.  It has with security, standards compliance and compatibility
 in mind, to behave just the same as today's major web browsers.  It

 cookies.sqlite formats of Mozilla Firefox, and its modular API makes
 it easy to add support for a new backend store.
